If you are looking for a way to remotely control your Nikon DSLR camera from your Mac computer, you might be interested in Camera Control Pro, a software application that allows you to adjust various settings, such as exposure, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, white balance, and more. You can also view the live view of your camera on your Mac screen, and trigger the shutter release from your keyboard or mouse.
     
However, Camera Control Pro is not a free software. You need to purchase a license key from Nikon to activate it. The price of the license key is $179.95, which might be too expensive for some users. Fortunately, there is a way to get Camera Control Pro for free, by using a keygen program that can generate a valid license key for you.

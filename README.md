creep
=====

I never found the pixel font that was perfect for me, so I decided to roll
my own with creep. It is a pretty compact (only 4px wide!) font that's great
for smaller screens (like my 11" laptop).

I'm constantly adding in new characters (diacritics, box-drawing characters, etc.),
so I figured I'd put it up on github for poeple to reap the gain this.

## Attribution
Before I created creep I was using Proggy Tiny, which is a great font
and has given me a lot of inspiration.
